# IFS Research Archive

This repository contains a curated collection of Institute for Family Studies (IFS) research PDFs, along with structured notes, synthesis memos, and briefing documents.

The goal of this archive is to support thoughtful analysis, internal synthesis, and clear communication across research, development, and leadership contexts.

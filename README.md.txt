# IFS Research Archive

This repository is a curated research and synthesis archive focused on the work of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).

It contains primary research PDFs, structured annotations, synthesis memos, and briefing documents designed to support thoughtful engagement with IFS’s intellectual portfolio across research, development, leadership, and public-facing contexts.

The purpose of this archive is not merely to store documents, but to **translate a body of research into coherent understanding, sound judgment, and clear communication**.

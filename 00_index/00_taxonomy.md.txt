# IFS Research Taxonomy

**Purpose:**  
This taxonomy defines the controlled vocabulary used to catalog, annotate, and synthesize documents in the IFS Research Archive.

Its goal is to ensure consistency, clarity, and intellectual discipline when describing themes, methods, and implications across the research portfolio.

This taxonomy is intentionally limited. New terms should be added sparingly and only when they clarify, not multiply, categories.

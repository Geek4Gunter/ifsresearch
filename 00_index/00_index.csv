Summary In the past year, four states—Utah, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas—have passed social -media parental - consent laws based on ideas put forward in a joint report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center and In - stitute for Family Studies, titled “ Protecting Teens from Big Tech ” (August 2022). These laws have important differences. Some include requiring full parental access or certain parental tools, some limit certain features for minor accounts, and others provide expansive exemptions. The upshot of this is that some laws are strong - er than others. Evaluating the different provisions is important, as these laws are being challenged in court. In light of recent litigation and other states’ desires to pass similar laws, Clare Morell, Adam Candeub, and Michael Toscano have put together a model bill for states to use, drawing on aspects of Utah’s initial legisla - tion and incorporating key edits and provisions—based on the recent injunction against Arkansas’s law—to strengthen it against legal challenges. The underlying approach of their model bill—the same as the laws passed thus far—is to require (1) online platforms to age-verify their users in the respective state and (2) ob - tain parental consent for a minor to open or operate a social media account if a user is under the age of 18. The goal is to restore parental authority and rights over children’s online behavior. The Need for Legislation These laws are needed because parents are effective - ly powerless to oversee their children’s online behav - ior, and there is a collective nature to the harms of social media. First, parents need help. Even the best parental -control software available for purchase does not offer full protection. Apps like TikTok or Snapchat don’t provide access to such external controls, and certain app features, like Instagram’s direct messaging, are beyond a parent’s view. Given the lack of current requirements for age verification, a child can easily falsify his age and go behind his parents’ back to open social media accounts—or open secret secondary accounts of which parents are unaware. For parents to effectively oversee their children’s online behavior, meaningful age verifica - tion and parental consent over social media account formation are necessary. Second, the collective na - ture of the harms of social media necessitates public - policy solutions. Individual parents are powerless against mammoth Big Tech companies and face",2022,,,,,,,auto_seeded

5th-circuit-age-verification-ruling.pdf,"technology and human flourishing Vindication by the Fifth Circuit Court of AppealsShaping Policy, Renewing Culture. On March 8, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a Texas law requiring age veri - fication measures to guard the state’s kids from por - nography sites. The decision is a major win for the children of the Lone Star State. It also represents a vindication of the policy work of scholars from the Center for Renewing America , the Ethics and Pub - lic Policy Center , and the Institute for Family Studies , who have fought a David -and -Goliath battle against powerful interests to see such laws enacted through - out the country. In August 2022, scholars from these three organi - zations published a joint policy brief titled, “ Protect - ing Teens from Big Tech: Five Policy Ideas for States.” The overarching objective of this brief was to provide legislative strategies to states seeking to protect chil - dren online and empower parents. Because of the inaction of Congress and some misguided rulings by the Supreme Court—decided long before social media and smartphones were invented—social me - dia platforms and pornography sites have been free to addict America’s children and expose them to ob - scene content with impunity, all of which has fostered a mental health crisis among adolescents on a histor - ic scale. The brief encouraged states to take action to protect children, rather than wait for the breaking of Congressional gridlock, and gave guidance for how states could do this effectively and constitutionally. The very first policy idea that our scholars proposed was to require age -verification for pornography sites and age-verification with parental consent for social media platforms. In 2023, nearly a dozen states im - plemented one or both of these measures. In 2024, by some counts , more than a dozen additional states are considering following their example. But these efforts have not come without challenge. Lobbyists representing Big Tech and Big Porn, aid - ed by the American commentariat, have been fiercely contesting these laws throughout the country, with an undue confidence that courts would find them unconstitutional. These gargantu - an companies have taken a shock and awe approach, suing every such law passed, trying to scare states away from taking action or causing them to second guess the underlying logic of their bills. From the beginning of this ef - fort, the scholars of the Center for Renewing America, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, and the Institute for Family Studies have maintained that judicial prece - dent only superficially weighed against these measures. A closer analysis of the rele - vant rulings shows that the underlying factual pred - icates upon which these decisions relied have been radically undermined by advances in technology, and, therefore, the precedents are ripe for revisiting. Our scholars have always maintained that the implementation of these laws was going to entail a ferocious battle, but that it was one that states could ultimately win. Therefore, we were vindicated and overjoyed, but not surprised, when the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the fol lowing : Applying rational-basis review, the age -verification requirement is rationally related to the govern - ment’s legitimate interest in preventing minors’ access to pornography. . . . Therefore, the age - verification requirement does not violate the First Amendment. We believe that the logic of this ruling can also be ap - plied to age -verification for social media platforms. With this decision, we strongly encourage lawmak - ers in more states to adopt these types of laws, and prepare to fight for them all the way up to the Su - preme Court. What we are striving for is nothing less than the heart and soul of America’s children.",2024,,,,,,,auto_seeded

final-andersonstone-ifspaidfamilyleavepolicybrief.pdf,"Policy Brief May 2020 A Child-Focused Paid Parental Leave Policy for the U.S. By: Rachel Anderson and Lyman Stone Executive Summary A highly contagious coronavirus has led communities to shutter businesses, schools, and public places, requiring families to undertake multiple roles at once: caregivers, educators, and workers. As our society relies on the health and capability of families right now, policymakers should consider future measures that strengthen families, particularly in their childrearing role. Prior to and during the COVID-19 crisis, politicians on both sides of the aisle recognized the need for a better family leave policy in America. In March, Congress secured emergency paid leave policy for families affected by COVID-19, including the closure of hundreds of thousands of schools and places of childcare. Once the crisis subsides, policymakers should look again at more permanent approaches to providing paid family leave. Family leave policies can be structured in widely divergent ways and aimed at very different ends. With a proliferation of proposals, it is vital that policymakers make evidence-based decisions with clear pathways to implementation and reasonable expectations of achieving specific policy outcomes. In order to have a family leave policy that fits such a demanding criteria, it is important to first survey existing literature to identify the range of effects that policymakers might expect to see from an expansion in paid family leave. This paper does so with a focus on paid parental leave, a topic that has garnered a sizeable body of research. Across the academic literature on family leave policies, especially maternity or paternity leave for new children, a variety of outcomes have been identified. There are four kinds of policy outcomes from family leave that are the focus of this report as they are of interest to policymakers and well-identified in academic research: improvements in child welfare and health, increases in achievement of fertility desires, increases in parental connection to gainful employment, and improvements in marital stability. In general, parental leave benefits provided in the first weeks of a child’s life have been most clearly shown to benefit child health and maternal attachment to work, with more mixed proof for impacts on marital stability, parental employment, and fertility achievement.",2020,,,,,,,auto_seeded

final-ifsparentsreport-1.pdf,"1 Research Brief August 2021 Homeward Bound: The Work-Family Reset in Post-COVID America By: Wendy Wang and Jenet Erickson Editor’s Note: This report is co-sponsored by The Wheatley Institution. Despite all the chaos and struggles over the past year, the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic gave many parents the first-hand experience of working from home. And they like it. Indeed, the possibilities in workplace flexibility created during the coronavirus crisis may have begun a reset in the way parents think about what they want in their work and family lives—a reset that looks “homeward bound.” More than half of parents with children under age 18 said that COVID-19 has made them more likely to prefer working from home, either most of the time (33%) or half of the time (20%), according to a new Institute for Family Studies/Wheatley Institution survey by YouGov. These feelings are shared by both mothers and fathers. Over half of fathers said the coronavirus pandemic has made them more likely to prefer working from home (either full or part time), while only 38% said that the impact of COVID-19 made them more likely to want to work from the office. Similarly, only 30% of mothers said the pandemic made them more likely to prefer working from the office most of the time. A majority (53%) of mothers would prefer to work from home most or half of the time. This question was asked of parents who said that their ideal situation was to work. The rest of the parents (18% of moms and 8% of dads) said they simply prefer to not work for pay at all. 313422193830020406080100FathersMothersFrom home most of timeFrom home half of timeFrom office most of timeWorkingfrom home is the preferred arrangement for parents after COVID-19% saying COVID-19 has madethem more likely to prefer...

final-ifsresearchbrief-ayers-evangelicalsandsex8819.pdf,"Research B rief August 2019 Current Sexual Practices of Evangelical Teens and Young Adults By: David J. Ayers Evangelicals1 have historically held a simple view of sex outside of marriage —don’t . Yet social science has shown for years that most self -identified Evangelicals engage in premarital sex. Despite the official teachings of their churches and clear instruction in the Bi ble, sex outside of marriage has become increasingly morally acceptable among them as well. For example, in the General Social Survey (GSS), in 2014 through 2018 combined, only 37% of “fundamentalist”2 adults said that sex outside marriage was “always wr ong,” while 41% said it was “not wrong at all.” From 1974 -1978, the same percentages were 44% and 27%, respectively. Meanwhile, the GSS showed that among never -married fundamentalist adults between 2008 and 2018, 86% of females had at least one male sex pa rtner since age 18, while 57% had three or more. For males, 82% had had at least one sex partner, and 65% had three or more. This includes respondents as young as 18 or 19, which reduces the percentages who are sexually active, because percentages rise as singles get older. In a previous analysis of 2000 -2016 GSS data for never -married members of conservative Protestant denominations who were 25 -40 years of age, I found that 89% of men and 92% of women had at least one opposite -sex partner in the past five years.3 The wholesale abandonment of most of the traditional sex ethic among modern Evangelicals is well -documented.4 Josh ua Harris is, of course , the most recent example. As Dale Kuehne 1 By the term ‘Evangelical’ I am referring specifically to Protestants who embrace the following core beliefs: “the Bible is the inspired, infallible and authoritative Word of God; classical doctrines on the Trinity; the virgin birth, perfect life, miracles, atoning dea th, physical resurrection, ascension to the right hand of the Father and personal return in power and glory of Jesus Christ; the lost and sinful state of all human beings, who can only be saved through by being ‘born again through faith in Christ alone’; t he work of that same Holy Spirit in the lives of all true believers; the resurrection of all humankind to either eternal life or eternal damnation; the spiritual unity of all true believers in Christ; the need to personally share with unbelievers their nee d to trust in Christ, to accept the free gift of salvation and the forgiveness of sins accomplished by his death on the cross.” Note that this is consistent with the National Association of Evangelicals understanding of this term, and what denominations wh o are part of the NAE generally embrace. 2 “Fundamentalist” and “conservative Protestant” in the GSS both match typical understandings of “Evangelical.” 3 See Ayers, David J. Christian Marriage: A Comprehensive Introduction (Bellingham: Lexham Press, 2018), page 68. 4 See ibid.

final2-ifs-single-americansbrief2020.pdf,"1 Research Brief Sept. 2020 More Than One -third of Prime -age Americans Have Never Married By: Wendy Wang America is the middle of two simultaneous trends related to marriage. Marriages today are more stable, thanks to the steady decline of divorce rates since the 1980s. At the same time, however, a declining share of Americans marry. In 2018, a record 35% of Americans ages 25 to 50, or 39 million, had never been married, according to a new Institute for Family Studies (IFS) analysis of U.S. Census data. The share was only 9% in 1970. Previous research suggest s that marriage rates tend to fall during a recession. With the Covid -19 stay -at-home order, and the financial fallout from the pandemic, we are most likely to see the share of never -married adults break new records in the near future. Many factors are related to the rise of never -marrieds. Young adults have taken their time to enter marriage. The median age for first -time marriages today is 28 for women and 30 for men. Back in 1970, Americans typically got married in their early 20s. Also, young adults today often live with their partner before getting married. Cohabitation is seen as an alternativ e living arrangement for couples, even if they do not plan to get married. Share of never -married adults reaches new high Notes : Based on adults ages 25 -50.

On average, an American woman is expected to have about 1.6 children in her lifetime. This is well below the population replacement level (2.1 children per woman). The pand emic has also put a damper on people’s desire to have children, with more American adults ages 55 and younger saying their fertility desire has decreas ed since COVID -19. The downward trend for U.S. fertility started long before the pandemic. T he fertility rate hovered around the replacement level during most of 1990s and 2000s and started to drop in 2008, in the wake of the Great Recession. It has not returned to the pre-recession level since. Recent research by Melissa Kearney and colleagues suggests that demographic, economic, or policy changes have little to do with this decline. Meanwhile, the marriage rate in the U.S. also hit an all-time low . For every 1,000 unmarried adults in 2019, only 33 got married. The number was 48 just about two decades ago in 2000. The decline of marriage goes hand in hand with falling fertility rates, simply because married women have a much hi gher fertility rate than unmarried women. In 2020 , the birt h rate was 81 per 1,000 married women ages 15 -44, but just 39 per 1000 unmarried women of the same age. When fewer women are married, fewer babies are born. In fact, about half of the decline in fertility since 2008 can be attributed to changes in marital composition, according to an",2022,,,,,,,auto_seeded

UGBs are rules or policies setting hard limits about where land can be developed, with development beyond those limits requiring hard -to-get special exemptions or permissions .

UGBs Are a Major Source of Unaffordable Housing for Young Families • UGBs increase land prices near the boundary by 8 - to 20-fold, with sharp discontinuities near boundaries. • 19 of the 20 least -affordable housing markets have UGBs. On the other hand, none of the most affordable markets have documented UGBs. UGBs May Imperil the Types of Housing Young Families Want Most • By limiting the amount of land available, UGBs may incentivize developers to build more tower -developments with small apartments, instead of single -family homes that our report reveals to be the overwhelmingly desire of young Americans. Federal Land Ownership Sometimes Acts as UGBs • Many cities, especially in Western states, may not have an official UGB but are hemmed in by federal lands. • The government often retains agriculturally fallow, ecologically unexceptional, and recreationally unused lands on the fringes of developed areas and roadways for much longer than is reasonable.",,,,,,,,needs_review

ifsresearchbrief-religiousmarriageparadox2.pdf,"Research Brief December 2021 The Religious Marriage Paradox: Younger Marriage, Less Divorce By: Lyman Stone and Brad Wilcox The new marriage norm for American men and women is to marry around the age of 30, according to the U.S. Census. Many young adults believe that marrying closer to age 30 reduces their risk of divorce, and, indeed, there is research consistent with that belief. But we also have evidence suggesting that religious Americans are less likely to divorce even as they are more likely to marry younger than 30. This paradoxical pattern raises two questions worth exploring: Is the way religious Americans form their marriages different than the way marriages are formed by their more secular peers? And do religious marriages formed by twenty-somethings face different divorce odds than marriages formed by secular Americans in the same age group? The answer to that last question is complicated by the role of cohabitation in contemporary family formation. Today, more than 70% of marriages are preceded by cohabitation, as Figure 1 indicates. Increased cohabitation is both cause and consequence of the rise in the age at first marriage. But what most young adults do not know is that cohabiting before marriage, especially with someone besides your future spouse, is also associated with an increased risk of divorce, as a recent Stanford study reports. So, one reason that religious marriages in America may be more stable is that religion reduces young adults’ odds of cohabiting prior to marriage, even though it increases their likelihood of marrying at a relatively young age. Accordingly, in this Institute for Family Studies research brief, we explore the relationships between religion, cohabitation, age at marriage, and divorce by looking at data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG).",2021,,,,,,,auto_seeded
ifsstrongfamiliesbetterstudentsresearchbrief-aug2022.pdf,"Research Brief August 2022 Strong Families, Better Student Performance: The More Things Change, The More They Remain the Same By: Nicholas Zill and Brad Wilcox As single -parent and stepparent families have become more common in the U.S., is it the case that children from these families have fewer problems than they used to? Many scholars believed that as alternative family types became more accep ted and less stigmatized, children from non -intact families would be less apt to exhibit learning, emotional, and behavior problems in school and elsewhere. Moreover, as government programs aimed at ameliorating the economic consequences of family instabil ity (i.e., Food Stamps,1 Medicaid, WIC,2 public housing, and child support enforcement) have grown, so, too, has the expectation that greater public support for vulnerable families would improve the life chances of children in single - parent families. More recently, educators have been under pressure from political leaders and social justice activists to make sure that their instructional and disciplinary practices do not contribute to unequal educational outcomes. In particular, advocates have criticiz ed schools for holding back lagging students from grade advancement and suspending or expelling students for serious misbehavior. Both interventions have tended to fall disproportionately upon children from non -intact families . These shifts in school discipline and pedagogy may have also minimized the consequences of family instability for children from single -parent and stepparent families in schools . In sum, it is possible that changes in the culture, public policy, and schooling have combined to make family instability less important for children’s school performance. On the other hand, hailing from an intact, married family may now be a greater ad vantage for children than ever. In a world marked by more electronic distractions, greater social atomization, and a more anemic community life, having the benefit of two, loving parents may be more valuable than it was even a quarter -century ago for our n ation’s children. Students’ performance and conduct in school are affected by the intellectual stimulation, emotional support, guidance, and discipline they receive at home. They are more likely to get the attention, affection, and direction they need to t hrive in school when they come from a family headed by their own married parents. This is especially true in a day and age when fathers in intact homes are more involved with their kids than ever before.

men-and-marriage-research-brief-1.pdf,"Men & Marriage: Debunking the Ball and Chain Myth W. Bradford Wilcox and Nicholas H. Wolfinger Return on Investment There’s no doubt that marriage requires sacrifices, and lots of them. Successful marriages require men to work harder, avoid cheating, spend less time with their friends, and make a good-faith eﬀort—day in and day out—to be emotionally present with their spouses. Being a good husband isn’t always easy. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE SACRIFICES PAY FOR THEMSELVES AND MORE.Marriage is not worth it for men. It’s not worth the practical and financial sacrifices, the lost romantic opportunities, or the “lack of freedom.” All in all, a spouse is a ball and chain—of little benefit to any man interested in pursuing happiness and well-being. Considering both the latest survey data and the continuing decline in the marriage rate, it’s fair to say that this viewpoint is becoming more entrenched in our society, particularly among younger men.1 But despite its prevalence, the ball and chain view of marriage is simply not supported by the research. Indeed, the benefits of marriage for men are substantial by every conceivable measure, including more money, a better sex life, and significantly better physical and mental health. Yet many men remain ignorant of these benefits, a view seemingly promoted by popular culture. .INTRODUCTION",,,,,,,,needs_review

zill-researchbrief-singleparentscollege.pdf,"Research Brief May 2020 For Getting Kids Through College, Single-Parent Families Are Not All the Same By: Nicholas Zill The 2020 senior classes in American high schools and colleges are graduating in a strange time. Virtual graduation ceremonies are replacing in-person gatherings out of fear of viral contagion. Graduates face a fall college semester full of uncertainties and a severely depressed job market. Many political figures continue to call for free college for everyone. Yet the cost of tuition and board is not the only obstacle to a student from a low-income or minority family getting into college and completing the coursework required to earn a bachelor’s degree. When open enrollment policies have been tried by colleges, large proportions of “at risk” students turned out to need remedial instruction, and few managed to graduate with a 4-year degree. When this has occurred, many have placed the blame on “poor performing” high schools and urged reforms to improve school efforts to prepare students for college. But those who seek to bolster achievement need to also pay attention to the role of families. Even without knowing anything about the specific high schools that a group of students have attended, one can do quite a good job of predicting which students will get college degrees and which ones will not. In fact, it is more informative to know about the family the student comes from, than the school to which he or she goes. Of course, it is also very helpful to know how well the student has done in high school in terms of grades and tested achievement. We tend to think of the various forms of single-parent families—those headed by separated or divorced mothers, never-married mothers, widowed mothers, or by fathers rather than mothers—as all alike, and all equally disadvantaged. And indeed, all these varieties of single-parent families do have lower average incomes than families with two married birth parents. Yet when it comes to putting kids through college, there are significant differences among these family forms. As shown below, children who grow up with a divorced or widowed mother are more likely to attend and graduate from a 4-year college than children who grow up with a separated or never-married mother, or with a separated, divorced, or never-married father. The reasons for the differences have partly to do with the characteristics of the women and men who wind up as divorced or widowed parents as opposed to separated or never-married parents, and with the financial and cultural circumstances in which children in these different family types are raised. But they also have to do with the continued participation of the non-resident parent in the child’s life, and the supports and safeguards that our social and legal institutions provide for some types of families but not others.",2020,,,,,,,auto_seeded

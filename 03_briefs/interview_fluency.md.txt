# Interview Fluency: IFS Research

This document captures concise language for interview and leadership conversations. The goal is calm authority, not persuasion-by-volume.

---

## “How would you describe IFS’s work?”

IFS focuses on how family structure, stability, and institutional context shape long-term outcomes for children and communities. The work emphasizes mechanisms, tradeoffs, and implementation realities rather than slogans or ideology.

---

## “What distinguishes IFS from other family-focused organizations?”

IFS consistently integrates empirical research with public-facing clarity. It takes contested questions seriously while maintaining scholarly posture and long-term credibility.

---

## “How does IFS approach policy?”

By asking how policies function in practice. Coverage, accessibility, and lived experience matter as much as intent.

---

## “Is the work ideological?”

The research is values-aware but method-driven. Claims are framed in terms of observable outcomes and mechanisms, not partisan alignment.

---

## “Where do you see the greatest opportunity?”

At the intersection of family stability, economic pressure, and technological change—particularly where institutions shape incentives for parents and children.

---

## “What’s most important to protect as the organization grows?”

Trust. Credibility compounds slowly and erodes quickly. Scholarly restraint is a strategic asset.
